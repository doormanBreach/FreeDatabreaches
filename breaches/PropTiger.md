# PropTiger database leak

## Description

2018-01-30

In January 2018, the Indian property website <a href="https://www.proptiger.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PropTiger</a> suffered a data breach which resulted in a 3.46GB database file being exposed and subsequently shared extensively on a popular hacking forum 2 years later. The exposed data contained both user records and login histories with over 2M unique customer email addresses. Exposed data also included additional personal attributes such as names, dates of birth, genders, IP addresses and passwords stored as MD5 hashes. PropTiger advised they believe the usability of the data is &quot;limited&quot; due to how certain data attributes were generated and stored. The data was provided to HIBP by <a href="https://dehashed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dehashed.com</a>.
