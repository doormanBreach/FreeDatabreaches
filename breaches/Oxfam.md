# Oxfam database leak

## Description

2021-01-20

In January 2021, <a href="https://www.oxfam.org.au/updates-suspected-data-incident/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oxfam Australia was the victim of a data breach</a> which exposed 1.8M unique email addresses of supporters of the charity. The data was put up for sale on a popular hacking forum and also included names, phone numbers, addresses, genders and dates of birth. A small number of people also had partial credit card data exposed (the first 6 and last 3 digits of the card, plus card type and expiry) and in some cases the bank name, account number and BSB were also exposed. The data was subsequently made freely available on the hacking forum later the following month.
