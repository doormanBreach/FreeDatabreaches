# AntiPublic database leak

## Description

2016-12-16

In December 2016, a huge list of email address and password pairs appeared in a &quot;combo list&quot; referred to as &quot;Anti Public&quot;. The list contained 458 million unique email addresses, many with multiple different passwords hacked from various online systems. The list was broadly circulated and used for &quot;credential stuffing&quot;, that is attackers employ it in an attempt to identify other online systems where the account owner had reused their password.
