In approximately 2012, it's alleged that the Chinese shopping site known as <a href="https://www.taobao.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taobao</a> suffered a data breach that impacted over 21 million subscribers. Whilst there is evidence that the data is legitimate, due to the difficulty of emphatically verifying the Chinese breach it has been flagged as &quot;unverified&quot;.
