# ExploitIn database leak

## Description

2016-10-13

In late 2016, a huge list of email address and password pairs appeared in a &quot;combo list&quot; referred to as &quot;Exploit.In&quot;. The list contained 593 million unique email addresses, many with multiple different passwords hacked from various online systems. The list was broadly circulated and used for &quot;credential stuffing&quot;, that is attackers employ it in an attempt to identify other online systems where the account owner had reused their password.
