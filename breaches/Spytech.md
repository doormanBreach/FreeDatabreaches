Designed to &quot;invisibly record everything users do&quot;, the breach exposed information related to both purchasers and targets of the product. Target data collection (and subsequent exposure) included the infected computer name, browsing history, applications used, usernames of authenticated users, keywords being monitored, file operations (creation and deletion), computer usage times and email addresses, often captured within the spyware's logs. The data also included the names, purchases and md5 password hashes of purchasers.
