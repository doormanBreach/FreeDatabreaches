# Dropbox database leak

## Description

2012-07-01

In mid-2012, Dropbox suffered a data breach which exposed the stored credentials of tens of millions of their customers. In August 2016, <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/read/dropbox-forces-password-resets-after-user-credentials-exposed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they forced password resets for customers they believed may be at risk</a>. A large volume of data totalling over 68 million records <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/read/hackers-stole-over-60-million-dropbox-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was subsequently traded online</a> and included email addresses and salted hashes of passwords (half of them SHA1, half of them bcrypt).
