# Warframe database leak

## Description

2014-11-24

In November 2014, the online game <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/gaming-site-warframe-hacked" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warframe was hacked</a> and 819k unique email addresses were exposed. Allegedly due to a SQL injection flaw in Drupal, the attack exposed usernames, email addresses and data in a "pass" column which adheres to the salted SHA12 password hashing pattern used by Drupal 7. Digital Extremes (the developers of Warframe), asserts the salted hashes are of "alias names" rather than passwords.
