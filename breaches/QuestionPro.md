# QuestionPro database leak

## Description

2022-05-21

In May 2022, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-try-to-extort-survey-firm-questionpro-after-alleged-data-theft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the survey website QuestionPro was the target of an extortion attempt relating to an alleged data breach</a>. Over 100GB of data containing 22M unique email addresses (some of which appear to be generated by the platform), are alleged to have been extracted from the service along with IP addresses, browser user agents and results relating to surveys. QuestionPro would not confirm whether a breach had occurred (although they did confirm they were the target of an extortion attempt), so the data was initially flagged as &quot;unverified&quot;. <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1555696116351377410" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Subsequent verification by impacted HIBP subscribers</a> later led to the removal of the unverified flag.
