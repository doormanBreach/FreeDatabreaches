# YouNow database leak

## Description

2019-02-15

In February 2019, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/hacker-strikes-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data from the live broadcasting service YouNow appeared for sale on a dark web marketplace</a>. Whilst it's not clear what date the actual breach occurred on, the impacted data included 18M unique email addresses, IP addresses, names, usernames and links to social media profiles. As authentication is performed via social providers, no passwords were exposed in the breach. Many records didn't have associated email addresses thus the unique number is lower than the reported total number of accounts. The data was provided to HIBP by a source who requested it be attributed to &quot;JimScott.Sec@protonmail.com&quot;.
