# Zoosk database leak

## Description

2011-01-01

In approximately 2011, an alleged breach of the dating website <a href="https://www.zoosk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zoosk</a> began circulating. Comprised of almost 53 million records, the data contained email addresses and plain text passwords. However, during extensive verification in May 2016 <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/heres-how-i-verify-data-breaches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no evidence could be found that the data was indeed sourced from the dating service</a>. This breach has consequently been flagged as <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/introducing-fabricated-data-breaches-to-have-i-been-pwned" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fabricated</a>; it's highly unlikely the data was sourced from Zoosk.
